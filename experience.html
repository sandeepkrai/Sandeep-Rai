                                    Our team was tasked with building a platform
                                    for food vendors to sell their products
                                    based on ONDC and we rose to the challenge
                                    by creating an innovative solution that
                                    impressed the judges. Our hard work and
                                    dedication paid off as we were awarded the
                                    first prize, which included a cash prize of
                                    25,000 and various other goodies. This win
                                    is a testament to my technical skills,
                                    creativity, and ability to work well in a
                                    team. I am grateful for this recognition and
                                    eager to apply the lessons I learned at this
                                    hackathon to future projects.</div>

                                    showcase the use of public APIs and our team
                                    developed a weather app using Flutter that
                                    was both functional and visually appealing.
                                    Our submission was ranked among the top 10
                                    and we were awarded Postman goodies as a

                                I developed a Flutter application to
