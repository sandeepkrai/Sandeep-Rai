                        utilized my skills in Flutter, a powerful cross-platform
                        development framework, to create a user-friendly and
                        intuitive frontend application. The goal was to provide
                        a seamless and convenient platform for individuals to
                        rent cars directly from their peers, eliminating the

                        versatility, I created a powerful API layer that
                        efficiently handles various functionalities, such as
                        user authentication, car availability management,
                        reservation handling, and secure payment integration.For
                        data storage and retrieval, I employed MySQL, a reliable
                        and widely used relational database management system.
                        With MySQL, I designed a well-structured database schema
                        that effectively organizes and stores crucial
                        information, such as user profiles, car details,

                    <div class="text-white description">The backend of the Accelth app was built using Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime that allows for server-side development. Node.js provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it highly scalable and efficient for handling multiple requests concurrently.

Key Components:

Express.js: The backend utilized the Express.js framework to build a robust and scalable API layer. Express.js provides a streamlined approach for routing requests, handling middleware, and managing server-side logic.

Authentication and Authorization:
 To ensure secure access to the app's functionalities, a robust authentication and authorization system was implemented. This involved using industry-standard techniques such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to generate and validate tokens, ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected routes.

User Management: The backend includes functionality to manage user profiles and account details. This includes user registration, login, and profile updates. User data, such as personal information and medical history, can be securely stored and retrieved from the database.

Video Call Integration: The backend integrates with video call services, allowing seamless communication between patients and doctors. WebRTC (Real-Time Communication) technology can be leveraged to establish secure and real-time video calls within the app.

Medication Catalog and Ordering: The backend provides APIs to manage the medication catalog, including details such as medicine names, descriptions, dosages, and prices. Users can search and browse through the catalog, add medications to their cart, and place orders. Integration with payment gateways can facilitate secure online transactions.

Data Storage: A NoSQL MongoDB database is used to store various types of data, </div>
